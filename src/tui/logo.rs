//! The wordmark, drawn in quadrant blocks from the project's SVG logo.
//!
//! The logo is a 50 by 5 pixel grid. The SVG separates its letters by a single
//! pixel, which is plenty at print size and nothing at all in a terminal, so a
//! second blank column is added to every gap and the letters land on their own
//! cells. Only quadrant characters are used, because they sit in the Block
//! Elements range that every terminal font carries. Nothing denser exists
//! there: the sextants that would halve the height rendered as empty boxes on
//! fonts without Unicode's legacy computing symbols.
//!
//! Each row pairs the glyphs with a colour mask of the same length. In the
//! mask `2` marks the accent, which is the 2, `1` the heading colour that the
//! letters take, and `0` a gap.
